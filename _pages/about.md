Hello! This is **Yamin** (雅敏). I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Neurdy Lab](https://www.cchanglab.net/home), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Catie Chang](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=catie-chang). Before joining Vandy, I obtained my master's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Xiaoli Guo](https://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/show-33-120.html) and [Prof. Shanbao Tong](https://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/show-33-123.html), and my bachelor's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University, working with [Prof. Gang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1t_akZoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am currently a Research Scientist Intern at Meta Reality Lab Research, working on multimodal hand foundation model and egocentric representation learning.

My research interest lies in:
- Multimodal representation learning
- AI for health and sensing
- Vision-language(-action) learning
- NeuroAI & Brain decoding
- Large-scale time-series modeling

<span style="color: #b520ac; font-weight: bold;">I'm open to research collaborations and actively seeking Summer 2026 internship opportunities! If you're interested in working together, feel free to reach out at yamin.li [at] vanderbilt.edu :D !</span>
