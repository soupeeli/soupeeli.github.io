Hello! This is Yamin (雅敏). I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in [Neurdy Lab](https://www.cchanglab.net/home), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Catie Chang](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=catie-chang). My research interest lies in dynamic EEG-fMRI correlation and brain signal decoding/representation learning. Before joining Vandy, I obtained my master's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Xiaoli Guo](https://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/show-33-120.html) and [Prof. Shanbao Tong](https://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/show-33-123.html), and my bachelor's degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University, working with [Prof. Gang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1t_akZoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

This page is still under construction haha!
